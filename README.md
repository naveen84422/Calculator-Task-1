# Java Calculator - Task 1

This project is a simple **command-line calculator** written in Java.  
It allows users to perform **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division** on two integers repeatedly until they choose to exit.  
This task demonstrates **basic Java programming concepts** like loops, methods, and switch-case statements.

# Code Overview

- Uses `Scanner` to take user input.
- Runs in a continuous `while(true)` loop until "Exit" is chosen.
- Implements a **switch-case** for different operations.
- Separate static methods:
  - addition(int a, int b)
  - subtraction(int a, int b)
  - multiplication(int a, int b)
  - division(int a, int b)
- Prints "Invalid input" if an unsupported option is entered.
- Uses "System.exit(0)" to terminate.

# Program Flow

1. The program asks for two integer inputs.
2. Displays a menu of operations.
3. Performs the selected operation using the respective method.
4. Loops back to the menu until **Exit (5)** is chosen.
5. Prints results in the console.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Sample Output

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

1 addition
2 subtraction
3 multiplication
4 division
5 exit
Enter your choice: 1
Result: 15

Enter your choice: 3
Result: 50

Enter your choice: 4

# Notes

- Division is **integer division**, meaning results will not have decimals.
- Make sure the second number is not zero when performing division to avoid errors.
- For floating-point calculations, modify the program to use `double` instead of `int`.
